# Realtime Twilio Integration

This example demonstrates how to connect the OpenAI Realtime API to a phone call using Twilio's Media Streams. The server handles incoming phone calls and streams audio between Twilio and the OpenAI Realtime API, enabling real-time voice conversations with an AI agent over the phone.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key with Realtime API access
- Twilio account with a phone number
- A tunneling service like ngrok to expose your local server

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd examples/realtime/twilio
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
   ```

3. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
   The server will start on port 8000 by default.

4. **Expose your server publicly:**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```
   Note the public URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)

5. **Update the TwiML response:**
   Edit `server.py` and replace `your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io` in the `incoming_call()` function with your actual ngrok URL.

6. **Configure your Twilio phone number:**
   - Log into your Twilio Console
   - Go to Phone Numbers → Manage → Active numbers
   - Click on your phone number
   - Set the webhook URL for incoming calls to: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/incoming-call`
   - Set the HTTP method to POST (or GET, both are supported)

## Usage

1. Call your Twilio phone number
2. You'll hear: "Hello! You're now connected to an AI assistant. You can start talking!"
3. Start speaking - the AI will respond in real-time
4. The assistant has access to tools like weather information and current time

## How It Works

1. **Incoming Call**: When someone calls your Twilio number, Twilio makes a request to `/incoming-call`
2. **TwiML Response**: The server returns TwiML that:
   - Plays a greeting message
   - Connects the call to a WebSocket stream at `/media-stream`
3. **WebSocket Connection**: Twilio establishes a WebSocket connection for bidirectional audio streaming
4. **Audio Processing**: 
   - Audio from the caller is base64 decoded and sent to OpenAI Realtime API
   - Audio responses from OpenAI are base64 encoded and sent back to Twilio
   - Twilio plays the audio to the caller

## Configuration

- **Port**: Set `PORT` environment variable (default: 8000)
- **OpenAI API Key**: Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Agent Instructions**: Modify the `RealtimeAgent` configuration in `server.py`
- **Tools**: Add or modify function tools in `server.py`

## Troubleshooting

- **WebSocket connection issues**: Ensure your ngrok URL is correct and publicly accessible
- **Audio quality**: Twilio streams audio in mulaw format at 8kHz, which may affect quality
- **Latency**: Network latency between Twilio, your server, and OpenAI affects response time
- **Logs**: Check the console output for detailed connection and error logs

## Architecture

```
Phone Call → Twilio → WebSocket → Your Server → OpenAI Realtime API
                                      ↓
                              RealtimeAgent with Tools
                                      ↓
                     Audio Response → Twilio → Phone Call
```

The server acts as a bridge between Twilio's Media Streams and OpenAI's Realtime API, handling the protocol differences and audio format conversions.
